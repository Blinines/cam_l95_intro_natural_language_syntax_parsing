Introduction

Background


https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dependencies_manual.pdf


Gold standard => Stanford dependencies, original version.
https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dependencies_manual.pdf
From version 3.5.2, default representation is the new UD (representation used in Benepar)
https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/USD_LREC14_paper_camera_ready.pdf

Major changes
- treatment of prepositions and case marking. No prep/pobj, instead any case-marking element (prepositions,
postpositions, clitic case markers) = dependent of the noun it attaches to or introduces 
*nmod* labels relations between two content words, *prep* case depending on its complement


When comparing gold standard to references
- correct if same head and dependency, and same dependency relation (either the same, either equivalent regarding
the changes between original SD and UD)
- summed up in a table


Notes on Benepar sentences
- sent-1. Different treatment of prepositions leads to different head tagging. All OK.
- sent-2. Whether 'might be snow' should have had a 'cop' tag for the snow, parser and gold standard yield different results
which shed light to the ambiguity. About the same. stays (about the same) (over ...) or stays (about the same over ())
- sent-3. 10K versus 10 K but same analysis, counting it as one for the accuracies. to aux vs mark, POS nn vs dep because
unknown, per second to words or and, only to 1 or MB, uses only 1 MB of RAM, parser faultly assigning head to adverbs 
or punct.
- sent-4. Parser finds two sentences hence two root structures. punct to root for the parser ? including interjections
vmod vs case + nmod. Struggles to deal with parenthesis.
- sent-5. Two sentences idied likewise for the gold standard and the parser. prt syntax, difficulties with `the original
Brown and C5 tagsets`, punctuations head, C5 as nummod for example, parser heading many tokens to the 'each'
- sent-6. Confusions with the mathematical formulas like O=(o1,o2,..oT) hence creates new sentences when there is the =
sign. For more adequate comparison with the gold standard, we remove the = part to get the new parsing. i.e. keeping only
O and Q. Most probablec tag/sequence => does not analyse correctly the head, mainly because of this /. head of algorithm,
most probable state, together with.
- sent-7. Parser uses three token for composed verbs used as adjectives (EM-trained, hand-tagged), hence in order to
compare to the gold standard, we just use trained and tagges in order to have the same number of words. Punctuation.
Is probably best suited : advmod vs amod, passive vs active form. Adverb vs adjective.
- sent-8. Parser detects two sentences because of the dot hence last sentence is alone. In the gold standard we chose
to use parataxis instead. proceed (to fashlane) (under) vs (proceed (to fashlane (under)))
- sent-9. Operates ccomp vs dep. Punctuation same problem. advcl vs ccomp.
- sent-10. MWE, pcomp vs advcl (constantly worrying + cf one example in previous example), mark
